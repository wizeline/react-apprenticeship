# Patterns for React

**What is a pattern?**
A pattern describes a problem that repeatedly appears in different ways and gives us a solution to solve it. This solution can be implemented multiple times but is the same solution at the core. 

For example, think of a bridge to connect two pieces of land. The bridge can be long enough, simple wood board, and will suffice. On the contrary, the two pieces of land are far apart; the solution will be a larger bridge built with different materials like the Golden Gate Bridge. The problem and solutions are similar, but the implementation is at different scales.

__List of Patterns:__

- **Custom Hooks**
- **High Order Components**
- **Extensible Styles**
- **Compound**
